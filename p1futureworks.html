       <h1>Reflection and the Future</h1>

       <p>The Life of a Programmer has been my greatest success thus far. I've decided to take a temporary break from writing following this, but when I come back, I have a lot of content planned.</p>
       <p>I didn't expect it to become the success that it did, but I'm grateful for everyone who has purchased a copy.</p>
       <p> In three months I will return to writing. For now, I'm going to take some much needed time off.</p>
       <p>Here's some ideas I've had lying around:</p>
       <ul></ul>
           <li><q>C Caverns: Learning to Memory Allocate</q></li>
           <li><q>A Kotlin Call to Arms: Mobile Development Memories</q></li>
           <li><q>Defining Arrays: Why and How</q></li>
           <li><q>Goats and Their Importance</q></li>

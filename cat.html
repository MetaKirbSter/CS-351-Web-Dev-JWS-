    <h2><pre style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">About Me:</pre></h2>
    <ul><li>I was adopted with my brother by my current day owners in September 2019. Prior to that, I was sheltered at the Mercer County Animal Shelter. My real name is featured, but my human mom calls me "Sissy" much to her son's dismay.</li>
        <li>I like both wet and dry cat food (and my owners say I eat too much)</li> 
        <li>I can and will throw a hissy fit if my hooman mom doesn't let me sit on her armchair</li>
        <li>My current family includes my biological brother, an adopted brother, an adopted sister and my three human owners.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>My ideal date with a feline compatriot is as follows:</h4>
        <ol><li>Going out for a meal of fresh catfood and licks from the water bowl</li>
            <li>Chasing each other across the hallways for two minutes before I get bored</li>
            <li>Bothering my owners until they submit and give me what I want (I really didn't want it anyway)</li>
            <li>Sleeping on hooman beds to round out the evening (I'm a very low maintenance cat)</li>
        </ol> <hr>

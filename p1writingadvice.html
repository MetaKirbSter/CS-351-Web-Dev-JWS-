        <p>In all seriousness though, becoming a writer isn't easy! I would suggest incoming authors start with a small story to get their feet wet with publishers.</p>
        <p>My first release was only about thirty pages. You don't need to create the next War and Peace as your starting point!</p>
        <p>Don't forget to do practice drills to get yourself in the habit of spitballing quick ideas.</p>
        <p>It's okay to take breaks! For every two hours you spend writing, give yourself at least a fifteen-minute break to get your bearings.</p>

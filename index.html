       <h2 style="font-family: Verdana;">About Me:</h2>
       <ul>
           <li>I started writing my first short novel, <q>C++ Woes</q>, in March of 2023 to mixed reviews.</li>
           <li>I've always had an interest in literature; writing has always come easy to me. I figure publishing works is worth a shot.</li>
           <li>My ideal scenery for writing is a quiet library with a cup of coffee in one hand, typing with the other.</li>
           <li>I don't know where my career will take me, but I know one thing: My passion for writing will never die.</li>
       </ul>
